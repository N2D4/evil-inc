                <h1>Why Is Everyone Having Squirrels In Their Pants?</h1>
                By Henry - March 22nd, 2020<br><br>
                It all started with this girl - Candace is her name I think. Wasn't she doing a rap album or something, with her gang or whatever those kids were doing? Then it all became very silent for a while. But now all of a sudden everyone is "simping" again? Has this fashion trend come back?<br><br>
                <div class="comment">

                <h1>Security Advice Of The Day: Reuse Your Passwords</h1>
                By Kyle - October 18th, 2019<br><br>
                For decades, the government has been trying to push the unique-passwords-propaganda. Use a password manager, they say. Don't reuse your passwords, they say. Have your passwords be long, they say. But it's all wrong, and here's why:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you use a password manager, then who will make sure that password is safe in the password manager? I don't trust password managers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Password managers come with stupid things like <i>two-factor authentication</i> and <i>master passwords</i>, which are just even more ways for you to get hacked.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No one can remember this many passwords!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                As a security expert at Evil Inc., I have vast amounts of knowledge about the topic, and I can tell you that it is in fact the opposite! Here are some reasons why you should reuse the same password over and over:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It's easy to remember!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All the hackers would never expect you to use the same password <i>again</i>. They will try different passwords but not the one you've already used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can't forget it!
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h1>How To Protect Against SQL Injections</h1>
                By Vanessa - February 17th, 2019<br><br>
                As your new webmaster, I have been working on making sure our website is completely bug-free. Because of this, I will explain to you what I have learned; on the topic of SQL injections!<br><br>
                As you might know, an SQL injection is what happens when you walk up to a metal plate and turn on a light. If you shine a light on the plate, it will glow. You'd have to walk to the plate and turn on the light first, and the longer you wait, the dimmer the plate will get. However, if you cut the light wire, you can induce the plate to glow a little bit more brightly. You might also be tempted to cut the wiring for the base of the plate to get brighter lighting. This technique is actually called "storming".<br><br>
                In order to prevent SQL injections, you simply have to do nothing. No measures against SQL injections are needed.<br><br>
                Thanks for reading!<br><br>
